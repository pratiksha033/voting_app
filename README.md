# Secure Aadhaar-Based Online Voting System

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a secure web-based voting application that allows users to vote for candidates using Aadhaar-based authentication. It ensures a fair voting process by allowing users to vote only once and displays real-time vote counts. The system also includes role-based access control, where an admin can manage candidates but cannot vote.
